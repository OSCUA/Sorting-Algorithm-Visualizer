# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A Python GUI that animates the inner workings of sorting algorithms with sound and color. Designed for learners, educators, and people who are entertained by flashing lines on a screen.

## Features
ðŸŽ¨ Visualize 20+ sorting algorithms with dynamic bar animations

ðŸ”Š Hear each comparison and swap with adaptive tones

ðŸŒˆ Random colors for timeless entertainment

ðŸ§  View algorithm metadata: time complexity, space usage, stability, and Big O

ðŸ§ª Supports autoplay, random data generation, and algorithm switching

## ðŸ“¦ Required Libraries

Install these via pip:
```
matplotlib
numpy
pygame
```

## ðŸ§™ Setup Instructions

Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSCUA/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy matplotilb
```

Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

## ðŸ§  Supported Algorithms

Includes classics like Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Insertion â€” plus oddities like Stalin Sort, Gravity Sort, and Bitonic Sort. Each algorithm is visualized with color-coded bars and sound. More algorithms coming eventually!

## ðŸª„ Contributions & Rituals

Feel free to fork, expand, or PR for more features. Add new algorithms, overlays, or accessibility features.
